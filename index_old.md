### About me
I am an interdisciplinary scientist driven by a deep curiosity about the human mind and a passion for translating scientific discovery into real-world solutions. My journey began with a foundation [...]

Today, I lead research that blends neuroscience, psychology and cutting-edge AI/ML technologies to understand and enhance the human experience. My work centres on the science of cognitive processes[...]  

<!-- The first is developing and validating a tech-augmented learning programme designed to enhance metacognition (ability to understand and regulate your own thinking processes) in adult learners.[...]  

In the second project, we are working with clinicians to develop and validate a novel multimodal autism screening and assessment tool that can be easily applied in both home and clinical settings.[...]  

<!-- My research focuses on brain mechanisms involved in cognitive processes such as decision-making, reinforcement learning, motivation and emotional regulation. I study cognition in healthy peop[...]  

To do that, I have carefully designed laboratory-based computerized tests and mobile apps to specifically measure the cognitive process of interest in humans, and developed computational models th[...]
