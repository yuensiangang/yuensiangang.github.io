## Option Generation Task
Loss of motivation is clinically debilitating and associated with serious functional consequences. Emerging evidence suggests that decision-making processes may be impaired in people with dysfunctional motivation, regardless of underlying pathology. One important process is the ability to self-generate options for behavior. Many patients with apathy or anhedonia can perform actions when prompted by others, but experience difficulty in initiating behaviors by themselves. Unfortunately, how we self-generate options for behavior is not well-understood. 

The option generation task ([Ang et al. 2018, Current Biology](/papers/Ang_et_al_2018_Current_Biology.pdf)) is a simple behavioral paradigm that allows us to probe this process in humans. Subjects have to draw, on a touchscreen computer, as many different paths as they can between two vertically aligned points within a time limit. Using our mathematical formulation of similarity between the traced paths, one can objectively measure:
* fluency - total number of options generated
* uniqueness - how different is each option from the next most similar option generated by everyone else
* diversity - how varied are each subject's generated options

This task has demonstrated, for the first time, that dopamine (a key neurotransmitter in the brain) plays a causal modulatory role in the process of option generation. We also found that the ability to generate options is associated with motivation levels. A major part of my research continues to investigate the neurochemical modulation of option generation. I am also exploring motivational deficits with this task in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
