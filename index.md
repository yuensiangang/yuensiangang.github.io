## My Research
Depression is a major public health issue involving significant personal, societal and economic costs. According to the WHO, it is the leading cause of disability and poor health worldwide, with more than 300 million people suffering from the disorder globally. In 2010, in the United States alone, depression was estimated to have cost $210 billion in lost productivity and clinical costs. 

Unfortunately, the etiology and pathophysiology of depression remains unclear. Moreover, standard treatments such as SSRI antidepressants are only fully effective for almost 30% of patients and it often takes multiple medication trials in combination with other therapeutic approaches to achieve even a modest response. The overall goal of my research is to improve diagnostic precision and enhance treatment efficacy of depression.

Using machine learning algorithms, my current work focuses on identifying neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – improves the diagnostic precision of depression and reliably predicts treatment outcome. I also develop new empirical tools and use computational modelling to understand how abnormalities in decision making may contribute to the profoundly disabling, yet difficult-to-treat symptom of motivational anhedonia in depression (or the loss of motivation in pursuing activities that were previously rewarding).
