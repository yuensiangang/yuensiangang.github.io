## My Research
Depression is the leading cause of disability and poor health worldwide, with more than 300 million people suffering from the disorder globally. Unfortunately, the etiology and pathophysiology of depression remains unclear. Moreover, unlike all other branches of medicine, treatment often proceeds via trial-and-error and is highly ineffective. 

My research aims to understand the causes, improve diagnostic precision and enhance the treatment efficacy of depression. This is done by:
* using machine learning algorithms in the analysis of multimodal data from demographic, clinical, behavioral and neuroimaging domains. The goals are to develop better classifications based upon the neurobiology of depression and to identify reliable treatment-specific predictors of response to antidepressants.  
* using computational methods to model cognitive processes such as decision-making, reinforcement learning, motivation and creativity. The goal is to break down and precisely quantify components of cognition, which can in turn be mapped onto the brain with pharmacological challenge and imaging techniques. Together, these will help us understand how disruptions in behavior and cognition arise in disorders such as depression.
