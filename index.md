### About me
I am an interdisciplinary scientist driven by a deep curiosity about the human mind and a passion for translating scientific discovery into real-world solutions. My journey began with a foundation in physics, where I learned to model complex systems, a skill that would later become central to my efforts to decode the intricacies of human behaviour. This curiosity led me to pursue a DPhil and Postdoctoral training in Clinical and Computational Neuroscience, where I explored how brain function gives rise to cognition, emotion and behaviour not just in theory, but in the lived experiences of people navigating health, learning and life.

Today, I lead research that blends neuroscience, psychology and cutting-edge AI/ML technologies to understand and enhance the human experience. My work centres on the science of cognitive processes: how we learn, decide, adapt and regulate ourselves in an ever-changing world. But my ultimate goal is to move beyond understanding and build tools and technologies that improve health outcomes, support lifelong learning and unlock human potential at scale. At the core of my team's mission is a commitment to scientific rigour, real-world relevance and human-centred innovation. Whether it’s empowering adults to become better learners through metacognitive training, or reimagining developmental screening for autism to make it more accessible and equitable, we aim to turn insights into impact.

<!-- The first is developing and validating a tech-augmented learning programme designed to enhance metacognition (ability to understand and regulate your own thinking processes) in adult learners. Together with experts in pedagogy, we are developing innovative digital tools that seamlessly blend rigorous scientific insights with practical applications, with the goals of redefining adult education, fostering lifelong learning and empowering individuals to achieve their fullest potential. 

In the second project, we are working with clinicians to develop and validate a novel multimodal autism screening and assessment tool that can be easily applied in both home and clinical settings. This would allow for nationwide screening for autism to be transferred from the labour-intensive clinic setting into the naturalistic home setting, which can be done at any time convenient to caregivers, potentially reduce the numbers of children who miss out on developmental surveillance. It would also reduce the ongoing manpower- and cost-burden to the national healthcare system and potentially free up medical staff to focus on delivering other acute and chronic medical care services. -->

<!-- My research focuses on brain mechanisms involved in cognitive processes such as decision-making, reinforcement learning, motivation and emotional regulation. I study cognition in healthy people and investigate how disruptions in cognition arise in illnesses such as depression, as well as how we can optimize human health and potential by understanding their impact on learning outcomes, skills training and workforce productivity.

To do that, I have carefully designed laboratory-based computerized tests and mobile apps to specifically measure the cognitive process of interest in humans, and developed computational models that instantiated algorithmic hypotheses about how humans perform the test and can help better understand variability in human behaviour at the individual level. Precise mathematical algorithms were used to find parameter values that best capture each individual’s behavioral pattern during the computerized tests. These parameters were in turn mapped onto the brain with pharmacological challenge and brain imaging techniques, which will help us understand how disrupted cognition might arise in disease. -->
