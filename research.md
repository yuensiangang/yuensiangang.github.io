# Research

ATLAS focuses on turning constructs into **instruments** that work in the real world.

## Programmes
1. **Metacognition & Adult Learning** <br> We are developing a tech-augmented learning intervention to enhance metacognition in adults and validating it in an RCT through self-reports, lab-based cognitive tests and neuroimaging.
2. **Developmental Digital Screening (ASD)** caregiver-friendly, home-based behavioural tests for earlier risk detection of autism in children.
3. **Digital Learning Quality Index (DALQI)** — a benchmark for digital programme quality, linking provider practices to learner outcomes.
4. **Foundational Instruments** — AMI, Option Generation Task, Cognitive Motivation Task.
