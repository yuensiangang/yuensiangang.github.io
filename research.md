# Research

ATLAS focuses on turning constructs into **instruments** that work in the real world.

## Programmes
1. **Metacognition & Adult Learning** <br> We are developing a tech-augmented learning intervention to enhance metacognition in adults and validating it in an RCT through self-reports, lab-based cognitive tests and neuroimaging.
2. **Developmental Digital Screening (ASD)** <br> We are developing a caregiver-friendly, home-based mobile app for earlier risk detection of autism in children and validating it in ASD and typically developing cohorts.  
3. **AI-driven Metacognition Scoring Engine** <br> We are designing and evaluating LLMs to extract structured indicators of metacognitive thinking from text.
